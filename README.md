# What it contains? 
The simulation right now contains Extended Kalman Filter, JPDA Filter, CFAR Algorithm.

# What are planned updates?
I plan to introduce scripting engine so you can write your own Kalman Filters with ease, add AESA radar which is now WIP in dev branch, and make it as realistic as possible.

# What's the point?
Simulation point is to properly simulate a radar.

# Why?
I got bored and I createed this
