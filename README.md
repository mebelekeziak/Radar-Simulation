# What it contains? 
The simulation right now contains Extended Kalman Filter, JPDA Filter, CFAR Algorithm, ~~basic AESA~~ (no workie ;( ), DBSCAN

# What are planned updates?
I plan to introduce scripting engine so you can write your own Kalman Filters with ease

# What's the point?
Simulation point is to properly simulate a radar.

# Why?
I got bored and I created this

# TODO:
improve stability and performance, better RCS modeling

# also this isnt an analysis tool but rather gamified radar screen? i mean yall can strip it off and just modify the code for ur purposes ig
