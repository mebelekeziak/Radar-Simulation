# What it contains? 
The simulation right now contains Extended Kalman Filter, JPDA Filter, CFAR Algorithm, basic AESA, DBSCAN, and a simple Fox‑1 missile model.
Configuration can now be supplied via **config.json** for easier tweaking.

# What are planned updates?
I plan to introduce scripting engine so you can write your own Kalman Filters with ease.
JSON configuration support is an initial step towards cleaner extensibility.

## Controls
* Click on a track to lock it with the radar.
* Press **M** to fire a Fox‑1 missile at the locked target.
* Press **U** to unlock the radar.

# What's the point?
Simulation point is to properly simulate a radar.

# Why?
I got bored and I createed this
